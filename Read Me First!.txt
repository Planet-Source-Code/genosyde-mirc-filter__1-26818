Next Version
#########
My next release (real soon) will be advanced IRC Command parcing.
Some commands look like:

	:dream.chatcon.net 001 BlackArchon :Welcome to the Otherside IRC Network BlackArchon
	:dream.chatcon.net 002 BlackArchon :Your host is dream.chatcon.net, running version irco4.0.0.rc3 [u2.10.10.pl13]
	:dream.chatcon.net 003 BlackArchon :This server was created Wed May 9 2001 at 02:47:57 GMT
	:dream.chatcon.net 004 BlackArchon dream.chatcon.net u2.10.10.pl13 acCdgiknoOprsSwx bHiklmnopqrsStv
	:dream.chatcon.net 251 BlackArchon :There are 124 users and 100 invisible on 9 servers
	:dream.chatcon.net 252 BlackArchon 8 :operator(s) online
	:dream.chatcon.net 254 BlackArchon 137 :channels formed
	:dream.chatcon.net 255 BlackArchon :I have 79 clients and 1 servers

..with the 3 digit Command codes.  I am already working on it and almost done, but I didn't want to submit a semi-working parsed application.
So I released the basic IRC Command version, that has some extra functions into it.  

Please Enjoy

This version basically works with all Ping Requests, Time Requests and Version Requests.  Grabs your local server, grabs anyone who Requests
information from your client, and changes it.  Normally you see [Ping request:] 0 sec .. well now the person trying to get your ping see's
[Ping Request:] Citadel Blocked this Request... nifty eh?  Just basic string parsing and rebuilding.
